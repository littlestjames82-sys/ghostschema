"""GhostSchema: API spec slicer, a GhostSlice companion.

Slices large API specifications down to what a task touches:
- OpenAPI 3.x JSON and standalone JSON Schema get the full treatment
  (selection + local $ref reachability + a reduced spec and manifest).
- GraphQL SDL gets an outline only, labelled outline everywhere.

Static parsing only. Remote $refs are never fetched. YAML is refused.
Input files are never modified. Python stdlib only.
